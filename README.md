#Toys - Simple CNN classifier program

## Overview

Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are used primarily to classify images (e.g. name what they see), cluster them by similarity (photo search), and perform object recognition within scenes. They are algorithms that can identify faces, individuals, street signs, tumors, platypuses and many other aspects of visual data (Skymind, n.d).

For this sample project, a program will be trained to classify objects that will fall among the following classes:
1. Dino (Dilophosaurus from the film franchise Jurassic Park)
2. Lugia (Legendary pocket monster from the anime franchise Pok√©mon)
3. Taz (Tasmanian Devil from the cartoon Looney Tunes)
